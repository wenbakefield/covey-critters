# CarnivalGameArea
## Problem Statement
After checking the Covey.Town, we felt Covey.Town lacked a variety of games. We can suggest adding some games in order to make Covey.Town more exciting and colorful. In order to achieve this we are planning a game plan with 2 steps.

 For the first step, we are considering the carnival theme. As it can add a new level of diversity for possible games. We are planning to create either a spin the wheel game or a spacebar game, with a UI that resembles strength test games) as the possible carnival game, where players enter a game there will be a time limit, and the player must press the max amount of space bar key pressed within that time constraints.

As we are implementing a game with a carnival theme, we have to give a prize to the user at the end of the game. For the prize, we are considering giving users various types of pets (lion, cat, duck, dog, mouse, ghost, dragon...) according to their score. These pets will have 2 functionality. First functionality is the pets being able to follow the user. Second functionality would be the pets having their own characteristic behaviors/movements. As an example, a ghost would be able to fly through tables (it will be visible as it will be “on” the table) or rat would be able to walk underneath the table (it will be invisible as it will be “under” the table). 

## User Stories
1. As a player I want to be able to have a pet for the session that will follow me around
2. As a player I want to be able to play a carnival type game (examples: turn the wheel, spacebar game - make it look like strength test games) so that I can win a pet based on my score
3. As a player I want to see the score, after I played a carnival type game (or space bar game)
